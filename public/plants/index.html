  <p>Here you can find what plants I&rsquo;m growing and some information about them. I may eventually build a quartz website with more in-depth information on how to germinate, care for, and harvest the plants that I am growing.</p>
<p>In general, I prefer to grow plants that are more functional than ornamental. I like plants that have medicinal value, or food crops that can be used to enhance my diet. I especially like food plants that are uncommon the Western cuisine and may not be possible to shop for where I live (edible chrysanthemum, otherwise known as tong hao, as an example). That being said, I do have some ornamental plants because how could I not?</p>
<h2 id="seeds--starters">Seeds &amp; Starters</h2>
<p>Plants that I have seeds or starters (cuttings, rhizomes, etc) for.</p>
<h2 id="germinating">Germinating</h2>
<p>These are the plants that are currently in my seed tray that I am attempting to start.</p>
<h3 id="st-johns-wort">St. John&rsquo;s Wort</h3>
<p><strong>Latin Name:</strong> <em>Hypericum perforatum</em> <br>
<strong>Planted:</strong> April 7, 2024 <br>
I currently have four cells I am attempting to germinate. I have attempted these in the past and have not had luck with them, but we do not get anywhere by giving up! This is my second attempt at these. These plants are said to have great medicinal properties, so I&rsquo;d love to get these sprouted and growing, but they are finicky with temperature and soil moisture.</p>
<h3 id="edible-chrysanthemum-tong-hao">Edible Chrysanthemum (Tong Hao)</h3>
<p><strong>Latin Name:</strong> <em>Chrysanthemum coronarium</em> -&gt; <em>Glebionis coronaria</em> <br>
<strong>Planted:</strong> April 13, 2024 <br>
<strong>Sprouted:</strong> April 16, 2024 <br>
I currently have four cells that I am attempting to germinate. The first of the cotyledons in the first pot have shown up, and the others are clearly starting to sprout. I can&rsquo;t wait to get these big enough to transplant into a pot! I have a friend who will likely take at least one of these plants once large enough. :&gt;</p>
<h2 id="potted">Potted</h2>
<p>These are plants that I have in pots. My plants are all currently indoor plants, but I will break this section into indoor/outdoor if this ever changes.</p>
