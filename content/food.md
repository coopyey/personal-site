I've been getting into trying to make new things, especially in an attempt to reduce cost and be a little healthier in general. I'll be tracking the things I do try to make here, along with my thoughts on each of these items. The goal is to keep track of what I did and didn't like, what I think I could change to make it better, and share the knowledge to anyone who stumbles their way here.

I'm still waffling about how to organize it, so the organization might change drastically every time I touch this page until I find something that I like.

# What I've Tried
## Chai Concentrate
I'll admit that I made this first because this is something that would make the house smell good, and also something my parents wouldn't want to try. I very much have been wanting to make my own chai concentratet so taht I can have chai whenever I want without having to spend a stupid amount of money at some coffee shop, and so that I can control how much sugar (and what kind of sugar) is in it. 

I ended up making this and not only did it make the entire house smell delightful, it came out way better than I expected. This was <i>so</i> good that I struggled to go to bed after making it. I wanted to make a chai so badly. ðŸ˜­ I will definitely be making this all the time.

<b><u>Ingredients</u></b><br />
- 5 cups water<br />
- 1/4 cup sugar<br />
- 2 tbs dark brown sugar<br />
- 1 tbs honey<br />
- 1/4 tsp vanilla extract<br />
- 3-4 tbs black tea <span style="font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">such as: assam, ceylon, darjeeling, english breakfast -- bags typically contain 1-1.5 tbs.</span><br />
- 2-3 cinnamon sticks<br />
- 12 whole cloves<br />
- 8 green cardamom pods<br />
- 1 tbs black peppercorns<br />
- 2-3 star anise <span style="font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">(I additionally added some anise seed)</span><br />
- 1/4 tsp ground nutmeg<br />
<br />
<u>Optional:</u><br />
- Allspice<br />
- Fennel seeds<span style="font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">(I regret not adding this - I will in future batches)</span><br />
- Vanilla bean<br />
- Crystallized ginger <span style="font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">(I just threw some in, probably about a half tbs worth?)</span><br />
<br />
<b><u>Instructions</u></b><br />
<b>1.</b> Crush whole spices (cinnamon sticks, cloves, star anise, cardamom pods, peppercorns, crystallized ginger) in a mortar and pestle or with a rolling pin into a coarse grind. <span style="font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">The goal is simply to open the spices up, not create a powder.</span><br />
<b>2.</b> Dry toast the crushed spices and any seeds in a pan over low heat for 2-3 minutes, until fragrant. <span style="font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">I prefer to do this in the saucepan you will ultimately use to make the concentrate.</span><br />
<b>3.</b> Add toasted spices, chopped ginger, nutmeg, and any additional spices (allspice, vanilla bean, and any additional spices) to saucepan. Add your water.<br />
<b>4.</b> Bring to a boil, then immediately reduce heat and simmer for 5-10 minutes. The longer you let it simmer, the stronger it will be. <span style="font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">I highly recommend the full ten minutes.</span><br />
<b>5.</b> After the spices simmer, return to a high boil, then remove from heat.<br />
<b>6.</b> Stir in the tea (or add your tea bags and give it a stir).<br />
<b>7.</b> Let tea steep for 3-5 minutes. <span style="font-size:10pt;font-style:italic;">Do <b>not</b> oversteep the tea or it will get bitter.</span><br />
<b>8.</b> Once steeping is done, immediately strain the spices and tea out of the water.<br />
<b>9.</b> While the chai is still warm, add all sweeteners and your vanilla extract.<br />
<b>10.</b> Let the chai cool to room temperature.<br />
<b>11.</b> Once cool, pour into a glass bottle and store.
