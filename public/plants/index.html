  <p>Here you can find what plants I&rsquo;m growing and some information about them. I may eventually build a quartz website with more in-depth information on how to germinate, care for, and harvest the plants that I am growing. I do extensive research into figuring out what is and what isn&rsquo;t invasive here, as well as what is on the noxious plants and banned lists for where I live. Plants that do live on that list stay strictly indoor to avoid spread, while the rest may eventually be introduced as container indoor/outdoor plants.</p>
<p>In general, I prefer to grow plants that are more functional than ornamental. I like plants that have medicinal value, or food crops that can be used to enhance my diet. I especially like food plants that are uncommon the Western cuisine and may not be possible to shop for where I live (edible chrysanthemum, otherwise known as tong hao, as an example). That being said, I do have some ornamental plants because how could I not?</p>

<p>Plants that I have seeds or starters (cuttings, rhizomes, etc) for. I&rsquo;ve separated these out based on where I ordered the seeds so I can also include my thoughts about the vendor as well.</p>

<br />
I was looking for a handful of very specific herbs when I found this website, and I've been very pleased with them thus far. Everything I've attempted to plant from them has not only done well, but has fully flourished. All of my plants from them have been absolutely thriving, save for the Saint John's Wort, which is the fussiest seed I've attempted to germinate thus far. They have a wide variety of seeds and a nice website to peruse.<br /><br />

All but the Saint John&rsquo;s have sprouted and are absolutely flourishing! I plan to plant catnip for the kitties, the korean licorice mint, and then spearmint. I have a friend that lives a few hours away that wants as much mint as I&rsquo;m willing to give her, so I plan on propogating a chocolate mint cutting for her, and give her some spearmint. I hadn&rsquo;t realized that I had received the licorice mint and anise hyssop with this pack so that will be a surprise for her since she loves mint plants as much as I do. :)</p>

I found this company while on the hunt for edible chrysanthemum seeds. They offer hard to find or unusual plants, including rhizomes for a <i>blue</i> tumeric plant that I'm keeping an eye open for to order. I have yet to receive my order from them but I am excited to try some new leafy greens and plant what my friend has affectionately labeled "goth tomat" this year to add some variety to the kitchen this year. This is also the only website of the three that have tumeric and ginger rhizomes/fingers, so definitely worth keeping an eye on!<br /><br />

All of these were bought with the intention of growing to eat. I plan to keep these primarily indoors to cheat the growing seasons since half of these seeds are Japanese plants and would struggle with the area that I live in due to differences in climate. This will be my first time trying to grow peppers so I hope that goes well. I saw them down in Texas on my last trip and was interested in them, so I hope they do well. I'm also rather excited for the tomatoes because tomatoes always do incredibly well where I live, and now that I work from home I can really be sure to baby them and make sure they get enough water so they flourish in the hot summers here. Very, very excited to get started on all of these plants. :>

I found this company while on the hunt for edible chrysanthemum seeds. They are who I ended up ordering my seeeds from, as they had the medium leaf variety that I wanted and had while I was visiting Texas. Their "about us" page impressed me: they take a multiple pronged approach to provide good seeds to those who wish to garden or grow food, and have an active interest in restoring the grasslands and soils. I can't comment on their claim to cultivate seeds using the best taste and hardiest plants, but we shall see how their seeds hold up.<br /><br />

My interest in this plant stems from a trip to Texas that I took to visit a friend. They introduced me to another friend, and all three of us went out to hot pot. It was my first time so I was mostly just trying to figure out how all of this worked, and my new friend grabbed some leafy green that looked like it could be wild rocket arugula, but ended up being this delightful plant instead! I am SO excited to grow a plant large enough to start cooking with it! These seeds started sprouting within 4 days of being planted, so I am already very pleased.

<!-- GERMIANTION SECTION -->
<h1 id="germination-station">Germination Station</h1>
<p>These are the plants I have sown seeds for that I&rsquo;m attempting to sprout. :&gt; I also have a hydroponic system that I will use to sprout seeds, though these also eventually make it to pots rather than saying in a water system. (At least for now - I would like to scale out and do a DIY hydro system, but it is not my top priority right now.)</p>
<h2 id="st-johns-wort">St. John&rsquo;s Wort</h2>
<p><strong>Latin Name:</strong> <em>Hypericum perforatum</em> <br>
<strong>Planted:</strong> April 7, 2024 <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Soil sow in grow tray on heating pad <br>
I currently have four cells I am attempting to germinate. I have attempted these in the past and have not had luck with them, but we do not get anywhere by giving up! This is my second attempt at these. These plants are said to have great medicinal properties, so I&rsquo;d love to get these sprouted and growing, but they are finicky with temperature and soil moisture. I have previously attempted to sow these hydroponically but struggled to keep the water at a high enough tempreature to encourage germination, so I have switched to soil sowing in a self-watering grow tray.</p>
<h2 id="edible-chrysanthemum-tong-hao">Edible Chrysanthemum (Tong Hao)</h2>
<p><strong>Latin Name:</strong> <em>Chrysanthemum coronarium</em> -&gt; <em>Glebionis coronaria</em> <br>
<strong>Planted:</strong> April 13, 2024 <br>
<strong>Sprouted:</strong> April 16, 2024 <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Soil sow in grow tray on heating pad <br>
I currently have four cells that I am attempting to germinate. Three of four cells have cotyledons popping up and are flourishing! I have a friend who will likely take at least one of these plants once large enough. :&gt;</p>
<h2 id="catnip">Catnip</h2>
<p><strong>Latin Name:</strong> <em>Nepeta cataria</em> <br>
<strong>Planted:</strong> April 17, 2023 <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Soil sow in grow tray on heating pad <br>
I currently have one cell that I am attempting to germinate. I hope the kitties appreciate all that I do for them. 😭</p>
<h2 id="chocolate-mint">Chocolate Mint</h2>
<p><strong>Latin Name:</strong> <em>Mentha piperita</em> <br>
<strong>Planted:</strong> April 17, 2023 <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Cutting in water, to be moved to soil once rooted <br>
I currently have one cutting that I am attempting to sprout. This is for a buddy of mine who loves mint as much as I do. :&gt;</p>
<h2 id="anise-hyssop">Anise Hyssop</h2>
<p><strong>Latin Name:</strong> <em>Agastache foeniculum</em> <br>
<strong>Planted:</strong> April 17, 2023 <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Soil sow in grow tray on heating pad <br>
Part of the mint family! I currently have two cells that I am attempting to germinate. I plan to keep one plant for myself, and take the second plant up to a friend of mine. :D</p>
<h2 id="korean-licorice-mint">Korean Licorice Mint</h2>
<p><strong>Latin Name:</strong> <em>Agastache rugosa</em> <br>

<!-- POTTED SECTION -->
<h1 id="potted-plants">Potted Plants</h1>
<p>These are plants that I have in pots. My plants are all currently indoor plants, but I will break this section into indoor/outdoor if this ever changes.</p>
<h2 id="aloe-pepe">Aloe Pepe</h2>
<p><strong>Latin Name:</strong> <em>Aloe descoingsii x haworthioides</em> <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Perennial <br>
<strong>Potted:</strong> March 2024 <br>
<strong>Pot:</strong> 6&quot; nursery pot <br>
I typically stay away from succulents because my growing environment tends to be on the chilly end and I just have had poor luck with succulents in the past, but this little guy stood out like a sore thumb. It is a dwarf succulent that grows regular leaves like aloe, but on the leaves are white teeth that give it a jagged, toothed appearance. The teeth are soft to the touch rather than spiny like a cactus, so it&rsquo;s quite fun to run your finger along and feel. Very funky little guy, and once I found out this particular cross was called &lsquo;Pepe,&rsquo; I was in love. Very excited to have this funky little guy in my collection.</p>
<h2 id="chocolate-mint-1">Chocolate Mint</h2>
<p><strong>Latin Name:</strong> <em>Mentha piperita</em> <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Perennial <br>
<strong>Potted:</strong> March 2024 <br>
<strong>Pot:</strong> 12&quot; terracotta pot (outside glazed) <br>
I just love mint, okay? It&rsquo;s a problem. This will be kept in a container since mint is such a prolific spreader, hah. Once it&rsquo;s big enough I will transplant it to a large container and move it outdoors because it does so well here and the bees like the flowers. :&gt;</p>
<p>As with all mint plants, if you wish to grow this, I very highly recommend container growing or growing in a raised bed. Mint has a huge tendency to take over entire beds or back yards if not careful, and can choke out other plants because of</p>
<h2 id="christmas-cactus">Christmas Cactus</h2>
<p><strong>Latin Name:</strong> <em>Schlumbergera</em> <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Perennial <br>
<strong>Potted:</strong> March 2024 <br>
<strong>Pot:</strong> 6&quot; nursery pot <br>
Mine is most likely from the buckleyi group, the &ldquo;true&rdquo; Christmas cactus with more lobed leaves, as opposed to the truncata group that typically blooms closer to Thanksgiving and has pointed leaves. Growing up, my mom kept one of these from the truncata group with the red flowers that I have typically seen on these plants. While I was visiting Texas, I saw this one on the shelf and was shocked to see <em>peach</em> flowers on it - not the normal white ranging to red that I&rsquo;m accustomed to. I had to leap at the opportunity to pick it up and bring it home!</p>
<h2 id="feverfew">Feverfew</h2>
<p><strong>Latin Name:</strong> <em>Chrysanthemum parthenium</em> <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Perennial <br>
<strong>Potted:</strong> January 2024 <br>
<strong>Pot:</strong> 6&quot; nursery pot <br>
<strong>This plant can possibly become invasive,</strong> so if you wish to grow it please check your state or country&rsquo;s department of agriculture to ensure they are not considereed a noxious weed or otherwise need quarantine.</p>
<p>This plant started out pretty fast but the growth slowed down for a while before exploding again after swapping to my plant shelf setup. I think that it suffereed in the same was as my mullein plant in that the previous setup required that I adjust my (singular) grow light to accommodate the taller plants, which made the smaller (at the time) plants receive less direct light. It&rsquo;s very happy now and growing well. :&gt;</p>
<h2 id="heal-all">Heal All</h2>
<p><strong>Latin Name:</strong> <em>Prunella vulgaris</em> <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Perennial <br>
<strong>Potted:</strong> January 2024 <br>
<strong>Pot:</strong> 6&quot; nursery pot <br>
<strong>This plant can easily become invasive,</strong> so if you wish to grow it please check your state or country&rsquo;s department of agriculture to ensure they are not considereed a noxious weed or otherwise need quarantine.</p>
<p>Heal-all is another member of the mint family, with pretty purple flowers. This plant was one of the first of my January seeds to sprouted, but it has been one of the slowest growing of all of them since then. It has been doing better since getting more consistent lighting and more even watering and temperature, so I think that I will see it really start to take off with the new shelf system I have. I look forward to seeing the flowers on this one. :&gt;</p>
<h2 id="jade-plant">Jade Plant</h2>
<p><strong>Latin Name:</strong> <em>Crassula ovata</em> <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Perennial <br>
<strong>Potted:</strong> June 2023 <br>
<strong>Pot:</strong> 12&quot; terracotta pot <br>
This plant was a gift from my dad when I told him that I wanted to start growing plants, and has definitely been there with me from the start. I love this slow-growing plant very much and have enjoyed working with it from day one. It has helped teach me a lot about patience as well as how to prune to promote new growth and fullness in the plant. I hope to keep it for many years to come. :&gt;</p>
<h2 id="juniper-bonsai">Juniper Bonsai</h2>
<p><strong>Latin Name:</strong> <em>Juniperus chinensis</em> <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Perennial <br>
<strong>Potted:</strong> March 2024 <br>
<strong>Pot:</strong> Bonsai pot <br>
I found this bonsai while I was down in Texas visiting a friend. I am not one that often impulse buys plants because I admittedly do not keep the best environment for plants, but this is one that just really spoke to me. I have been going out of my way to make my growth area hospitable towards it so that it will thrive.</p>
<p>This will be hands-down the most difficult plant I have to take care of. Juniper bonsais are notorious for being near-impossible to take care of indoors, which is where I am caring for it. This is due to complications about how it is a tree that is pot-bound and requires regular repotting or transplanting to replenish nutrients in the soil, as well as their strict light, humidity, and temperature requirements. People also typically use soil that retains far too much water and can cause root rot or other issues. I will be leaving it in its current pot for the year, and will begin looking for a larger pot for it near the end of this year to transplant it early spring next year.</p>
<h2 id="marshmallow">Marshmallow</h2>
<p><strong>Latin Name:</strong> <em>Althaea officinalis</em> <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Perennial <br>
<strong>Potted:</strong> January 2024 <br>
<strong>Pot:</strong> 6&quot; nursery pot <br>
I wish that this plant grew the fun little treats that we put on top of hot cocoa. :( Pollinators <i>love</i> this plant, so if you are wanting something toa dd a little variety and encourage the bees, this is a good place to go. Of my January plants, this is the one that&rsquo;s absolutely shot up and grown the fastest and strongest. It is because of this plant I am looking to see how to accommodate tall plants indoors, because it is absolutely pushing the limits of what I have set up, hah. I should really just put it outside and let it thrive in the already hot spring we&rsquo;re having. I have no conern that this will grow very strong.</p>
<h2 id="mugwort">Mugwort</h2>
<p><strong>Latin Name:</strong> <em>Artemisia vulgaris</em> <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Perennial <br>
<strong>Potted:</strong> January 2024 <br>
<strong>Pot:</strong> 6&quot; nursery pot <br>
<strong>This plant can easily become invasive,</strong> so if you wish to grow it please check your state or country&rsquo;s department of agriculture to ensure they are not considereed a noxious weed or otherwise need quarantine. Because of how fast this plant grows and how invasive it is, this plant should really be grown in a container to avoid unwated spread.</p>
<p>This lovely flowering plant is commonly used for beer making, and may also help to treat things such as anxiety, digestion, irregular periods, and other things.</p>
<h2 id="mullein">Mullein</h2>
<p><strong>Latin Name:</strong> <em>Verbascum densiflorum</em> <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Biennial <br>
<strong>Potted:</strong> January 2024 <br>
<strong>Pot:</strong> 6&quot; nursery pot <br>
This plant requires open ground to germinate and is thus not typically very invasive, but if you live in a plains area or anywhere with wide-open area, please consider checking with your state or country&rsquo;s department of agriculture to ensure they are not considereed a noxious weed or otherwise need quarantine. (Fun fact: each plant can produce 100,000-240,000 seeds!)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen pictures of this plant but I still didn&rsquo;t expect it to be so fun! The leaves are broad and very, very fuzzy - a general joy to touch. This plant has been EXPLODING with growth lately, so I am going to need to find a nice big pot to put it in. These guys grow to be 2-7 feet tall, and 1-3 feet wide, so I have my work cut out for me, hah.</p>
<h2 id="string-of-turtles">String of Turtles</h2>
<p><strong>Latin Name:</strong> <em>Peperomia prostrata</em> <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Perennial <br>
<strong>Potted:</strong> March 2024 <br>
<strong>Pot:</strong> Hanging pot from store <br>
I&rsquo;ve always wanted one of these plants because I find them to just be the cutest things on the face of the planet and I&rsquo;ve always, always, always wanteed one. I have it hanging in my office window where it gets moderate sun and a lot of indirect light. We&rsquo;ll see how it fares with the cats, and I&rsquo;ll move it if I have to. (So far the cats haven&rsquo;t seemed to view it as a toy, so that&rsquo;s a <strong>huge</strong> bonus.)</p>
<h2 id="valerian">Valerian</h2>
<p><strong>Latin Name:</strong> <em>Valeriana officinalis</em> <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Perennial <br>
<strong>Potted:</strong> January 2024 <br>
<strong>Pot:</strong> 6&quot; nursery pot <br>
Valerian is a plant that I&rsquo;ve seen without know what I was looking at, and I&rsquo;m rather excited to grow it and see it flower. I&rsquo;m sure that the variety I have is a white valerian, but gosh I&rsquo;d love to have gotten a pink or red variety - maybe in the future! This is another one that has been growing a lot more slowly than I expected, but it&rsquo;s still chugging along and doing well despite my general nervousness.</p>
<h2 id="yarrow">Yarrow</h2>
<p><strong>Latin Name:</strong> <em>Archillea millefolium</em> <br>
<strong>Type:</strong> Perennial <br>
<strong>Potted:</strong> January 2024 <br>
<strong>Pot:</strong> 6&quot; nursery pot <br>
<strong>This plant is toxic to cats, dogs, and horses, an can aggrevate hayfever in some individuals. This plant can also easily become invasive,</strong> so if you wish to grow it please check your state or country&rsquo;s department of agriculture to ensure they are not considereed a noxious weed or otherwise need quarantine.</p>
<p>This plant is more slow-growing than the others I have potted, but it started doing <em>very</em> well once I switched to the plant shelves and swapped out my grow lights. I wonder if it wasn&rsquo;t quite getting enough light in the old setup because I had to adjust the light height based on the taller plants. The leaves on it are all very cute and I&rsquo;m very happy with it thus far!</p>
