    <p class="my-4">
      I am Coop, a very tired trans man currently living in the midwest United States. I'd love to someday move somewhere bigger and a little kinder in the future. My interests include video games, TTRPGs, plant germination & care, piercings, tattoos, biking, and snowboarding. I love cyberpunk, biopunk, and meatpunk; sci-fi and horror are my general go-to genres for most things.
