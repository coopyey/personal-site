This page is a place for me to log my currently active campaigns (and maybe also throw shoutouts to my friends along the way).

I keep a Quartz page with my campaign notes <a href="https://ttrpg.coopyey.gay" target="_blank">here</a>.

## System Discussion
Over time I have found myself moving more and more towards systems that are skill-based (Cyberpunk RED) rather than dice-RNG-based (D&D5E). I find it a lot more fun to build characters that are good at specific things and really shine when doing the things they are good at rather than leaving everything up to the roll of the dice, and anyone can do anything as long as they roll well enough. 

There's something REALLY fun about having a media built to doxx people on the internet and uncover information by sifting through the NET and being the sole person in the group who can do that, while someone else in the group's entire build is just looking cool and facedowning everyone that they run into. (Also, who doesn't love having a +20 to doing something?)

I also have interest in systems that focus less on combat and more on the narrative, and are perhaps closer to rules-lite. I have no experience in this area, though, and don't have much of an opinion formed of these systems outside of they sure look neat.

### Systems I Love:
• Cyberpunk RED \
• Pathfinder 2E \
• Dungeons & Dragons 4E

### Systems I Wanna Try:
• Cyberpunk 2020 \
• Degenesis \
• Vampire: The Masquerade \
• Mothership \
• Numenera (Cypher System) \
• Olds Gods of Appalachia \
• Blade Runner The RPG \
• Vast Grimm (Mörk Borg)
